# Individual Claim Submission ‚Äî Claimant ID: C-2023-0831

## 1. Summary of Allegations

This submission documents a pre-litigation claim against an individual (Claimant ID: C-2023-0831), who served as my personal assistant for seven months. The claimant is a familial relative (cousin), significantly younger, and was entrusted with confidential responsibilities and access to institutional assets.

On 31 August 2023, a sudden and fabricated incident involving alleged law enforcement (RAB) intervention was orchestrated, causing severe psychological distress, reputational harm, and loss of access to institutional property. The claimant played a central role in this deception, and subsequent actions suggest deliberate exploitation and coordinated defamation.
