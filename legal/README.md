## 📌 Usage Guidelines

1. All legal matters begin with documentation in `individual-claims/` or `group-claims/`
2. If internal resolution is attempted → move to `disputes/`
3. If legal notices or protection are issued → move to `notices/` or `protection/`
4. If formal litigation begins → move to `litigation/`
5. If resolved through fines or settlements → move to `penalties/`
6. Each transition must be recorded in:
   - `claim-metadata.json`
   - `audit-log.md`
   - `legal-roadmap.md`
