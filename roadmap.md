## ✅ 8. Audit Entries — Daily Constitutional Actions

### 🗓️ 2025-10-29 — Task Manager Observation

- **Module:** SDF-INIT-01  
- **Action:** Opened Task Manager, sorted by CPU and RAM  
- **Findings:** Chrome and PowerShell consuming high CPU  
- **Reflection:** Background processes impact system even when idle  
- **Next Step:** Compare with PowerShell `Get-Process`

---

### 🗓️ 2025-10-30 — Script Activation and Reporting

- **Module:** SDF-OBS-01, SDF-OBS-02  
- **Action:** Created and tested `get-process.ps1` and `get-service.ps1`  
- **Report:** Exported CSV to `/Reports-en/Performance/cpu-usage-2025-10-30.csv`  
- **Reflection:** Observation now audit-traceable  
- **Next Step:** Begin `get-counter.ps1` and Markdown summary

---

## 📚 9. Stewardship Continuity Notes

- All audit entries in `README.md` are mirrored here for traceability  
- New entries should be added **chronologically at the bottom**  
- Each entry must include: **Date**, **Time**, **Action**, **Findings (if any)**, and **Reflection**  
- This roadmap is a living document — designed for inheritance, not display
