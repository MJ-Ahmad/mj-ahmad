# Stewardship Archive — Ethical Inheritance Hub

This archive enshrines three constitutional pillars of stewardship:

- `supporters/`: Monthly or one-time contributors
- `donors/`: High-impact contributors with institutional trust
- `loans/`: Crisis-time micro-loan records with repayment and closure

Each folder contains child-readable, audit-traceable, and inheritable artifacts. Every inclusion is purposeful, restrained, and ethically documented.

Scripts in `scripts/` automate record creation, gratitude dispatch, ledger updates, and closure — all with constitutional dignity.

Audit logs and metadata ensure traceability and legacy integrity.
