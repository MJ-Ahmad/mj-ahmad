📖🤲 Unite & Support: Help Sustain the Largest Quran Printing Operation in Bangladesh

Dear Esteemed Community and Generous Hearts,

Today, I reach out to you in a moment of vital need, anchored by faith and a mission that transcends beyond mere business—it's about nurturing spiritual growth and education. As the head of the largest Quran printing company in Bangladesh, I find myself at a crossroads, striving to uphold our revered tradition of disseminating the Holy Quran Majeed.

🌙 Pheriwala of Quran: A Beacon of Hope & Knowledge  
Our company, registered in London and operating passionately from the heart of Bangladesh, prints the Quran Majeed with special symbols immensely valuable to the memorization students. Our efforts have sparked a profound interest across religious studies, with an imminent demand for 40,000 copies for the January session. This is no small feat—it is a testament to the dedication and love for the Holy Book that we share as a community.

🕊️ Empowering the Future: Free Scriptures for Orphan Children  
With absolute conviction, we have solemnly pledged that all orphan children across the nation will receive the Quran Majeed absolutely free of charge. In the spirit of compassion, we also extend our support to impoverished students, ensuring no seeker of knowledge is left behind.

💸 The Challenge: A Call for Urgent Funding  
The cost of printing one Quran Majeed is approximately 350 taka, amounting to the staggering total of 1 crore 40 lakh taka needed for 40,000 copies. Simultaneously, we're navigating through a financial tempest that has left us with a debt of about half a crore taka. Without immediate action, we are at risk of losing both reputation and market demand—a prospect too harrowing to imagine.

⏳ The Time is Now: Preserve a Legacy  
We are on the brink of missing our crucial deadline to prepare for the January session. Any delay now, and we risk losing not only our standing but also the ability to nourish the thirst for knowledge that so many young minds possess.

In the past two years alone, 1 lakh 70 thousand copies of the Quran have been printed and distributed at no cost, a feat driven by profound religious sentiment. The role you could play in sustaining this noble endeavour cannot be overemphasized.

👐 Calling for Solidarity: Your Contribution Can Make a Difference  
This is an appeal to your generosity, to assist in the continuation of printing and distributing the Holy Quran while providing debt relief. Your contribution will be a beacon of hope, preserving the essence of our religious commitment, Insha'Allah.

To join us in this crucial journey and make a contribution, please visit our website or contact us directly. Every act of kindness will have a ripple effect, bringing light and knowledge to many.

Together, we are more than a force; we are a movement of compassion and faith. Lend your support and let's overcome this challenge, Insha'Allah.
