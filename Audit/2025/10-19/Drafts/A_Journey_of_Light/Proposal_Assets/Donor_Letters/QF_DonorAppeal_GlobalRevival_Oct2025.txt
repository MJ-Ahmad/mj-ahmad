Subject: Global Appeal to Restore and Elevate Bangladesh’s Leading Qur’an Printing Institution

Dear Respected Patron,

Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah.

We write to you from Quraner Fariwala Ltd.—Bangladesh’s foremost publisher of memorization-optimized Qur’an Majeed editions. For over a decade, our mission has been to print and distribute high-quality Qur’ans to students, madrasas, and communities across the nation. Our editions are now used in hundreds of institutions, including Tanjimul Ummah Foundation and many Hifz centres.

However, the past two years have brought unprecedented challenges. Due to the pandemic, inflation, and operational disruptions, our institution has accumulated significant debt and is now at risk of collapse. Staff salaries, supplier dues, and printing operations are all under strain. We currently have no active funding and urgently need support to revive and rebuild.

We are now launching a global campaign titled:

📜 “A Journey of Light: Global Revival of Qur’anic Access”

Our goal is to print and distribute 40,000 memorization-optimized Qur’ans by January 2026, while also restoring our infrastructure, settling legacy debts, and building a sustainable future.

🕌 Total Budget Required: 16,216,800 BDT  
(Approx. $146,500 USD / £120,000 GBP)

This includes:
- Qur’an printing and packaging
- Debt recovery and staff restoration
- Legal, operational, and contingency reserves
- Global outreach and donor engagement
