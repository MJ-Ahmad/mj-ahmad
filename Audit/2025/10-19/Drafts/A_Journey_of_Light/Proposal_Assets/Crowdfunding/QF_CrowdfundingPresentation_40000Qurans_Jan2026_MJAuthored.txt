🌟 Crowdfunding Presentation: Quraner Fariwala – A Journey of Light
📌 Campaign Title:
Print 40,000 Qurans for Orphans & Underprivileged Students in Bangladesh

🕌 About Us:
Quraner Fariwala Ltd is the largest Quran printing company in Bangladesh and a UK-registered educational support organization (Reg. 14066998, SIC 85600). We serve over five million Hifz students by providing memorization-optimized Qurans, free educational materials, and institutional reform.

📖 The Crisis:
Due to economic hardship and rising costs, we are unable to print 40,000 copies of the Quran Majeed needed by January 2026. These copies are destined for orphans, underprivileged students, and rural madrasas across Bangladesh. Without urgent support, many will be deprived of the opportunity to read the Holy Quran during Ramadan.

🎯 Our Goal:
Print and distribute 40,000 Qurans

Clear ৳50 lakh (৳5 million) in operational debt

Sustain free Quranic education for vulnerable communities

💸 How You Can Help:
