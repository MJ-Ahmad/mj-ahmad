# 📜 Quraner Fariwala — Legal Continuity Declaration

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Steward:** MJ Ahmad  
**Institution:** Quraner Fariwala Ltd  
**Location:** Dhaka, Bangladesh & UK (Company No. 14066998)

---

## 🛡️ Declaration of Intent

Quraner Fariwala Ltd remains an active and ethically committed institution dedicated to the printing, distribution, and protection of Qur’an Majeed across Bangladesh and beyond. Despite financial constraints and temporary administrative lapses, the stewardship of this institution has not been abandoned.

We affirm our intent to:

- Renew all relevant trade licenses under local jurisdiction  
- Reinstate UK registration via Companies House  
- Resume Qur’an printing and distribution with full transparency  
- Maintain public documentation of all legal, financial, and institutional steps

---

## ⚠️ Constraints & Context

Due to extreme financial hardship and ethical survival conditions, the following constraints are currently in effect:

- Trade license renewal has been delayed for two consecutive years  
- UK registration was disabled due to non-submission of annual updates  
- No cash reserves are currently available to initiate renewal procedures  
- All stewardship work is being conducted under constitutional documentation and public transparency

---

## 🧾 Public Documentation & Protection

To prevent misinterpretation, harassment, or institutional harm, the following documents are publicly available:

- [Restoration Plan](quraner-fariwala-restoration-plan.md)  
- [Campaign Manifesto](quraner-fariwala-campaign-manifesto.md)  
- [Fund Log & Audit Trail](../personal-fund-log.md)  
- [Support MJ Declaration](../support-mj.md)

These documents serve as proof of continuity, ethical intent, and stewardship integrity.

---

## 📨 Legal Correspondence Prepared

Formal letters have been drafted and will be submitted to:

- **Local Trade License Authority** — Requesting grace period and renewal support  
- **UK Companies House** — Requesting dormant status or reinstatement

All correspondence will be version-controlled and publicly logged.

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

- Activate donation gateway to support legal and institutional restoration  
- Resume Qur’an printing and distribution by Q1 2026  
- Maintain monthly updates and audit logs for public review  
- Ensure all legal actions are traceable, ethical, and constitutionally documented

---

## 🏷️ Stewardship Statement

> Quraner Fariwala is not a business — it is a sanctuary of ethical inheritance.  
> Every delay is documented. Every step is traceable. Every intention is public.
