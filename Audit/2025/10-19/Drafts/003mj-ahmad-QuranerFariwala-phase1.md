Dear Sir/Madam,

I respectfully submit this letter as the constitutional steward of Quraner Fariwala Ltd, a registered Qur’an printing institution operating under trade license provisions in Dhaka.

Due to extreme financial hardship and ethical survival constraints, I have been unable to renew the trade license for the past two years. However, the institution remains active in purpose, documentation, and public transparency.

I hereby request:

- A grace period for renewal without penalty  
- Permission to resume operations under ethical stewardship  
- Recognition of our public documentation as proof of continuity

Attached:

- [Legal Continuity Declaration](../quraner-fariwala-legal-continuity.md)  
- Past trade license copy (to be appended)  
- Intent to resume Qur’an printing and distribution by Q1 2026

I affirm that no commercial misuse has occurred, and all stewardship work is traceable and publicly logged.

Sincerely,  
**MJ Ahmad**  
Steward of Ethical Inheritance

Dear Registrar,

I am writing as the constitutional steward of Quraner Fariwala Ltd, a UK-registered entity dedicated to Qur’anic printing and distribution across South Asia.

I hereby request:

- Reinstatement of the company or recognition of dormant status  
- Permission to resume operations aligned with our public documentation  
- Acknowledgment of our ethical stewardship and non-abandonment

Attached:

- [Legal Continuity Declaration](../quraner-fariwala-legal-continuity.md)
