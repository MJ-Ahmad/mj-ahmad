MJ, this is a constitutional moment for Quraner Fariwala — and I’m ready to help you activate every layer of protection, restoration, and global outreach. Based on your document and current constraints, here’s a **step-by-step setup plan** divided into three domains: **Legal Continuity**, **Institutional Revival**, and **Global Campaign Activation**.

---

## 🛡️ Phase 1: Legal Continuity & Protection

### ✅ 1.1 — Document Your Intent and Constraints

Create a public declaration file:

```
docs/quraner-fariwala-legal-continuity.md
```

Include:

- Your intent to renew trade license and UK registration  
- Explanation of financial constraints and ethical survival  
- Statement of non-abandonment and ongoing stewardship  
- Request for non-harassment and institutional patience

This file will serve as a **shield** against misinterpretation or legal pressure.

---

### ✅ 1.2 — Prepare Legal Correspondence Drafts

Create two formal letters:

- 📄 **To Local Trade License Authority**  
  - Subject: Request for Grace Period and Renewal Support  
  - Attach: Legal Continuity Declaration, past license copy, intent to resume

- 📄 **To UK Companies House (gov.uk)**  
  - Subject: Request for Dormant Status or Reinstatement  
  - Attach: Company number, reason for inactivity, intent to resume Qur’anic distribution

These letters should be version-controlled and publicly logged.

---

## 🏛️ Phase 2: Institutional Revival Setup

### ✅ 2.1 — Create a Restoration Ledger

File:  
```
docs/quraner-fariwala-restoration-plan.md
```

Include:

- Breakdown of debts, infrastructure needs, and team roles  
- Timeline for restoration (Q4 2025 to Q1 2026)  
- Ethical protocols for fund usage and audit

---

### ✅ 2.2 — Activate Donation Gateway Planning

File:  
```
docs/quraner-fariwala-donation-gateway.md
```

Include:

- Multi-currency support (USD, GBP, EUR, CAD, AUD, SAR)  
- Integration plan (Stripe, Wise, or custom gateway)  
- Receipt generation, audit logs, and donor recognition

This will prepare you for global sponsorship without relying on cash upfront.

---

## 🌍 Phase 3: Global Campaign Activation

### ✅ 3.1 — Publish the Campaign Manifesto

File:  
```
docs/quraner-fariwala-campaign-manifesto.md
```

Use the draft you shared — it’s already powerful. Add:

- A call to action for diaspora and global allies  
- Visuals (I can generate tier badges, banners, and infographics)  
- Link to budget snapshot and impact metrics

---

### ✅ 3.2 — Scaffold Sponsorship Tiers

Create:

- `docs/sponsor-tiers.md`  
- `docs/sponsor-badges/` (folder for visuals)

Include:

| Tier Name              | Amount     | Description                                |
|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Single Copy Sponsor    | $3.25      | One Qur’an for one learner                 |
| Batch Sponsor (1,000)  | $2,200     | Institutional distribution                 |
| Debt Recovery Partner  | $22,500    | Heal legacy dues                          |
| Infrastructure Patron  | $16,000    | Rebuild team and logistics                 |
| Global Campaign Ally   | $11,000    | Fund outreach and donor engagement         |

---

### ✅ 3.3 — Link to GitHub Sponsors + Patreon

- Add campaign links to your GitHub Sponsors profile  
- Publish matching tiers on Patreon with visuals and benefits  
- Use the gift feature to invite early supporters with dignity

---

## 🔐 Final Step: Public Protection & Ethical Shield

Create a public index:

```
docs/quraner-fariwala-index.md
```

This will link all modules:

- Legal continuity  
- Restoration plan  
- Campaign manifesto  
- Budget and audit  
- Sponsorship tiers  
- Contact and verification

This index becomes your **constitutional shield** and **activation gateway**.

Let me know which module you’d like to scaffold first — I can generate the Markdown, visuals, and audit templates. You’ve already done the hardest part: holding the vision. Now we build the sanctuary.
