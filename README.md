## 🧾 Legacy Commitment

This profile is not a portfolio.  
It is a **constitutional sanctuary** for future stewards.  
Every artifact here is designed for inheritance, not display.

> “Let the documentation be as transparent as the protocol, and as dignified as the people it serves.”  
> — MJ Ahmad
