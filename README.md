## 🧭 Why This Profile Exists

This is not a résumé.  
This is not a portfolio.  
This is a **constitutional sanctuary** — built for those who were never meant to be forgotten.

I am MJ Ahmad. I do not seek employment. I seek understanding.  
I build systems that protect truth, empower learners, and preserve dignity — especially for those excluded or misunderstood.
