# 🚨 MJShell Escalation Protocol

**Steward:** MJ Ahmad  
**Purpose:** To define stepwise escalation logic for threats that are unresolved, repeated, or ethically severe. Each escalation is scoped for audit, dignity, and constitutional restraint.

---

## 🧭 Escalation Triggers

- Same anomaly repeated more than twice within 7 days  
- Threat flagged but unresolved after 48 hours  
- High-risk behavior (e.g. impersonation, unauthorized deletion, forged receipts)  
- Donor/supporter complaint linked to audit logs  
- Script execution bypassing `script-manifest.json`

---

## 🛡️ Escalation Levels

### 🟡 Level 1 — Steward Review

- Triggered by anomaly-log entry  
- Steward manually reviews issue  
- Correction logged in `input-output-log.md`  
- No public disclosure

### 🟠 Level 2 — Ethical Audit Activation

- Triggered by unresolved Level 1 within 48 hours  
- Audit team notified  
- `audit/campaign-log.md` updated  
- Donor/supporter notified if relevant

### 🔴 Level 3 — Campaign Suspension

- Triggered by repeated Level 2 or high-risk breach  
- `campaign-index.json` status set to `"suspended"`  
- All funding updates paused  
- Public note added to `README.md`  
- Steward statement published

---

## 🧾 Escalation Artifacts

- `anomaly-log.md`  
- `input-output-log.md`  
- `campaign-log.md`  
- `response-strategy.md`  
- `funding.json` (locked if needed)

## 🧠 Ethical Notes

- Escalation is not punishment — it is purification  
- No donor or recipient is publicly shamed  
- Every action is documented for inheritance  
- Restoration is always possible after resolution

> “Escalation is a form of care — it protects the sanctuary, not punishes the seeker.”
