### ‚ö†Ô∏è Observations

- No deletions were confirmed ‚Äî likely due to file locks, system protection, or silent failures.
- Chrome cache folder was not found ‚Äî possibly not installed or profile missing.
- Recycle Bin emptied, but no confirmation of item count.
- No errors were thrown, but deletions may have silently failed due to locked or protected files.

---

### üîç Recommendations

- Replace `Clear-Folder` with `Force-ClearFolder` to handle locked/read-only files.
- Add deletion counters to track success/failure per folder.
- Consider adding disk usage audit (`disk-space-check.ps1`) to identify largest folders.

### üõ°Ô∏è Stewardship Integrity
