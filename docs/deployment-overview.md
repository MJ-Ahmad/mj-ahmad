# Deployment Records Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

The Deployment Records section defines how the system is activated, reproduced, and traced. It ensures that every setup is documented, every rollout is ethical, and every deployment honors the sanctuary’s integrity. This is not installation — it is emergence with consent.

---

## 📁 Included Modules

- [`deployment-guide.md`](deployment-guide.md) — Setup and activation instructions  
- [`deployment-record.md`](deployment-record.md) — Deployment history and traceability

---

## 🔗 Interlinked Systems

- Distribution protocols (`distribution-engine/README.md`)  
- Governance ratification (`ratified-actions.md`)  
- Audit traceability (`audit/change-log.json`)  
- Metadata validation (`index.metadata.json`)  
- Ethics validation (`nxn-ethics/README.md`)

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No deployment may occur without audit logging  
- No setup may bypass ethics validation  
- No record may be altered post-activation without ratification  
- No steward may activate modules without glossary clarity

---

## 📜 Licensing & Stewardship

Governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. All deployment actions require steward consent, metadata validation, and traceable documentation. Activation is not access — it is responsibility.
