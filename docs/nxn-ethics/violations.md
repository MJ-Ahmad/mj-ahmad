**Module Type**: Constitutional Safeguard  
**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document records all ethical violations, misuse attempts, and logic breaches within the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. It is not a blacklist — it is a memory of mistakes, so they are not repeated.

---

## 🚫 Violation Format

Each entry must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "violation_id": "VX-2025-001",
  "date_detected": "2025-10-16",
  "module": "merit-engine",
  "description": "Scorecard logic applied without steward activation",
  "severity": "moderate",
  "reviewed_by": "MJ Ahmad",
  "status": "resolved",
  "audit_hash": "abc123def456..."
}
```

---

## 🛡️ Review Protocol

- All violations must be reviewed by a steward listed in `visionary-roles.md`  
- All entries must be linked to an audit hash  
- All resolutions must be documented and traceable  
- Repeat violations must trigger a governance review

## 🔐 Licensing

This ledger is governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. No entry may be deleted, obscured, or anonymized without constitutional review.
