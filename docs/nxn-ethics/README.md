# nxn-ethics — Logic Misuse Prevention

**Curated by**: MJ Ahmad — Steward of Ethical Inheritance  
**Module Type**: Constitutional Safeguard  
**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This module defines the ethical boundaries of logic within the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. It prevents misuse, distortion, and unauthorized inference by enforcing constitutional safeguards.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **No Derivation Without Consent**  
  Logic must not be applied to artifacts without steward approval.

- **No Inference Without Boundaries**  
  All reasoning must respect module scope, role limits, and lineage.

- **No Misuse Without Detection**  
  All logic misuse must be logged, reviewed, and traceable.

- **No Silence on Distortion**  
  All ethical violations must be documented in `violations.md`.

## 🚫 Forbidden Logic Patterns

| Pattern              | Status     | Notes                                           |
|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Uncited transformation | ❌ Blocked | Must include audit hash and lineage              |
| Roleless derivation   | ❌ Blocked | Must match contributor registry                  |
| Cultural distortion   | ❌ Logged  | Must be reviewed by ethics steward               |
| Ego-driven logic      | ❌ Logged  | Must be flagged in merit scorecard               |
| Inheritance breakage  | ❌ Logged  | Must be documented in audit log                  |

## 🛡️ Safeguard Protocols

- All logic modules must include `nxn-ethics` as a dependency  
- All derivations must pass `SemanticClarity` and `InheritanceSafe`  
- All violations must be reviewed by [Visionary Roles](../governance/visionary-roles.md)

## 🔐 Licensing

This module is governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. All logic must be traceable, ethical, and free from distortion.
