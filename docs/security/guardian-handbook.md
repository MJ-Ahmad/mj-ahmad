## 🔐 Core Responsibilities

- Monitor `threat-model.md` for emerging risks  
- Validate all logic modules against `nxn-ethics`  
- Ensure glossary linkage for child readability  
- Confirm audit hashes match `change-log.json`  
- Reject any artifact with `review_status: pending` or `rejected`  
- Log all breaches in `violations.md` with steward consent

---

## 🧾 Required Tools

- `audit/change-log.json` — Trace every edit  
- `nxn-ethics/violations.md` — Log misuse  
- `distribution-engine/README.md` — Gate outbound files  
- `review-protocol.md` — Ratify artifacts  
- `role-activation.md` — Confirm steward legitimacy

---

## 🧘 Ethical Boundaries

Guardians must:

- Protect without policing  
- Review without ranking  
- Intervene without ego  
- Document without distortion
