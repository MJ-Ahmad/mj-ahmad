# Incident Response — Ethical Recovery Protocol

**Curated by**: MJ Ahmad — Steward of Ethical Inheritance  
**Document Type**: Security Governance  
**Last Updated**: October 17, 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This protocol defines how stewards respond to misuse, breach, or distortion within the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. It is not a punishment system — it is a constitutional healing process.

---

## 🛑 Trigger Conditions

An incident response is activated when:

- A logic module violates `nxn-ethics`  
- A file is distributed without metadata or review  
- A steward bypasses `role-activation.md`  
- A glossary breach confuses or excludes learners  
- A violation is logged in `violations.md`

## 🔄 Response Steps

| Step                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Log the breach           | Record in `nxn-ethics/violations.md` with steward consent                  |
| Freeze the artifact      | Set `review_status: rejected` in metadata                                  |
| Notify guardians         | Alert via `guardian-handbook.md` protocol                                  |
| Audit the lineage        | Trace via `audit/change-log.json`                                          |
| Review ethically         | Invoke `review-protocol.md` with clarity and consent                       |
| Restore or retire        | Either revise the artifact or archive it with dignity

## 🧘 Steward Conduct

During incident response, stewards must:

- Avoid blame or prestige  
- Preserve audit traceability  
- Prioritize learner protection  
- Document every step for inheritance

---

## 🔐 Licensing

All incident responses are governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. No breach may be hidden, and no steward may be erased.
