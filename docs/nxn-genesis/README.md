# nxn-genesis — Foundational Logic Engine

**Curated by**: MJ Ahmad — Steward of Ethical Inheritance  
**Module Type**: Constitutional Logic Framework  
**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025

## 🧭 Purpose

The nxn-genesis module defines the foundational logic engine for the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. It governs how truth is derived, validated, and inherited across all modules — without bias, hierarchy, or distortion.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **No Assumption Without Lineage**  
  Every logical claim must cite its origin, derivation, and steward approval.

- **No Inference Without Boundaries**  
  All reasoning must operate within documented constitutional limits.

- **No Truth Without Traceability**  
  Every output must be reproducible, auditable, and ethically documented.

- **No Logic Without Legacy**  
  All systems must be designed for inheritance — not just execution.

## 🔍 Logic Structure

| Layer        | Function                                | Boundaries                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Input        | Accepts structured, documented artifacts | Must reject undocumented or unclear input  |
| Validation   | Verifies lineage, clarity, and ethics    | Must log all failures and edge cases       |
| Derivation   | Applies constitutional logic rules       | Must cite every transformation step        |
| Output       | Produces traceable, inheritable results  | Must include metadata and audit hash       |

## 🧾 Genesis Metadata

Each logic output must include:

- `input_source`: file path or module name  
- `logic_rule`: applied derivation principle  
- `date_executed`: ISO format  
- `steward`: executor identity  
- `audit_hash`: Git commit or SHA256  
- `output_type`: validation, transformation, synthesis  
- `traceability_score`: 0.0 to 1.0

## 🔐 Licensing

This module is governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. All logic must be documented, reproducible, and free from distortion.
