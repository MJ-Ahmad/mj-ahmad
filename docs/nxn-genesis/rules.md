## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the logic rules used by the nxn-genesis engine to derive, validate, and inherit truth across all modules. These rules are not algorithms — they are ethical boundaries for reasoning.

## 🧠 Core Logic Rules

| Rule Name         | Description                                      | Boundaries                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `LineageRequired` | No claim without documented origin               | Must cite source, steward, and date             |
| `SemanticClarity` | No output without child-readable logic           | Must avoid jargon, ambiguity, or elitism        |
| `AuditLinked`     | No transformation without audit hash             | Must include Git or SHA256 reference            |
| `RoleBound`       | No logic outside steward’s activated role        | Must match contributor registry                 |
| `InheritanceSafe` | No output that cannot be reused or inherited     | Must include metadata and reproducibility notes |

## 🔍 Rule Application

Each logic operation must:

1. Validate input against `LineageRequired`  
2. Derive output using `SemanticClarity` and `InheritanceSafe`  
3. Link transformation to `AuditLinked`  
4. Confirm contributor via `RoleBound`  
5. Log result with traceability score

## 🧾 Rule Metadata

Each rule must include:

- `rule_name`: as listed above  
- `description`: plain language explanation  
- `applied_in`: list of modules using this rule  
- `last_reviewed`: ISO date  
- `steward`: reviewer identity  
- `audit_hash`: Git or SHA256 reference
