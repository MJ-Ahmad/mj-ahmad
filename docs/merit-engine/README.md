## 🧭 Purpose

The Merit Engine is a constitutional module that defines how contributions are ethically valued within the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. It replaces hierarchy with traceability, prestige with clarity, and competition with stewardship.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **No Leaderboards**  
  Merit is not a ranking — it is a record of ethical impact.

- **No Ego Metrics**  
  No likes, stars, or follower counts. Only traceable contributions.

- **No Hidden Influence**  
  All merit must be documented, reviewed, and auditable.

- **No Bias**  
  Merit must be language-neutral, culture-neutral, and role-neutral.

## 🧾 Merit Metadata

Each contribution must include:

- `contributor`: steward name or ID  
- `date_contributed`: ISO format  
- `module`: Quraner Fariwala, Audit Engine, etc.  
- `contribution_type`: documentation, script, review, translation  
- `impact_scope`: local, module-wide, constitutional  
- `audit_hash`: Git commit or SHA256  
- `review_status`: approved, pending, rejected  
- `merit_score`: calculated via ethical weight, not popularity
