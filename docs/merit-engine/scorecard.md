Each entry must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "contributor": "MJ Ahmad",

## 🧮 Merit Calculation Notes

- `merit_score` is calculated based on contribution type, clarity, reproducibility, and ethical amplifiers  
- Scores are **not cumulative** — each entry stands alone  
- No contributor may edit their own scorecard entry without review

---

## 🛡️ Review Protocol

All entries must be reviewed by:

- [Visionary Roles](../governance/visionary-roles.md)  
- [Audit Policy](../governance/audit-policy.md)  
- [Community Charter](../governance/community-charter.md)

---

## 🔐 Licensing

This scorecard is governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. It must remain transparent, traceable, and free from manipulation.
