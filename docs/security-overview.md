# Security Protocols Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

The Security Protocols section defines how the system prepares for, responds to, and recovers from threats. It protects the sanctuary from distortion, ensures ethical incident handling, and activates guardian roles during emergencies. This is not fear — it is stewardship under pressure.
