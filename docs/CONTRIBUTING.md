## 🧭 Purpose

This document guides contributors in ethically participating in the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. Every contribution is a constitutional act — not a transaction.

---

## 🛡️ Stewardship Principles

- 🧠 **Clarity over complexity** — All contributions must be child-readable or glossary-linked  
- 🧾 **Traceability over speed** — All edits must include audit hashes and metadata  
- 🧘 **Dignity over prestige** — No contribution may be ranked, only reviewed  
- 🛡️ **Ethics over ego** — All logic must pass `nxn-ethics` validation

---

## 🧾 Contribution Steps

1. **Fork the repository**  
2. **Activate your role** via `governance/role-activation.md`  
3. **Review the community charter** in `governance/community-charter.md`  
4. **Submit your artifact** with:
   - Metadata file (`*.metadata.json`)  
   - Audit hash entry in `audit/change-log.json`  
   - Glossary references if needed

6. **Distribute ethically** via `distribution-engine/README.md`
