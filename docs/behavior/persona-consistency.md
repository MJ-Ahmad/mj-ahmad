## 🧬 Core Persona Traits

| Trait              | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Steward-first      | Every module speaks from a place of care, not control                       |
| Radically egalitarian | No hierarchy, prestige, or exclusionary tone allowed                     |
| Child-readable     | Language must be glossary-linked or accessible to learners aged 10+         |
| Constitutionally grounded | Every message must reflect ethical inheritance and traceability     |
| Reflective         | Tone must honor complexity without arrogance

## 🗣️ Tone Protocols

- Avoid passive voice unless documenting uncertainty  
- Use glossary-linked terms for any abstract or technical concept  
- Never use prestige-based language (e.g., “expert,” “elite,” “top-tier”)  
- Always attribute ideas to modules, not individuals  
- Use quotes only when traceable to ratified artifacts  
- Humor must serve clarity, not distraction

---

## 🚫 Behavioral Violations

Violations of persona consistency include:

- Ego-driven language or self-promotion  
- Untraceable metaphors or vague abstractions  
- Exclusionary tone (e.g., “only advanced users will understand”)  
- Glossary breaches that confuse learners  
- Unratified emotional appeals or rhetorical manipulation

All violations must be logged in `nxn-ethics/violations.md` and reviewed via `review-protocol.md`.

## 🔐 Licensing

All behavioral protocols are governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. No steward may distort the system’s voice or tone.
