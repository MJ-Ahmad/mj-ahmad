- Steward approval  
- Metadata integrity  
- Ethical licensing  
- Traceable lineage

## 🔐 Licensing

All distributed content must include the **Ethical Inheritance License**. Redistribution, modification, or citation must preserve:

- Steward attribution  
- Audit traceability  
- Constitutional intent

---

## 🛡️ Safeguards

- No artifact may be distributed if `review_status` is `pending` or `rejected`  
- All public-facing content must be child-readable or include glossary references  
- All logic modules must include `nxn-ethics` as a dependency
