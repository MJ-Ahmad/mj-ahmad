# Tokenomics Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

The Tokenomics section defines how value circulates, what it represents, and how it is ethically exchanged. It ensures that every token honors purpose, every transfer is traceable, and every circulation logic reflects dignity — not dominance. This is not currency — it is constitutional meaning.

## 📁 Included Modules

- [`tokenomics.md`](tokenomics.md) — Value logic and circulation boundaries

## 🔗 Interlinked Systems

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No token may circulate without glossary clarity  
- No value may be exchanged without purpose justification  
- No steward may receive tokens without ethics validation  
- No circulation logic may bypass audit traceability

---

## 📜 Licensing & Stewardship

Governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. All tokenomics logic requires steward consent, metadata validation, and glossary compliance. Circulation is not transaction — it is traceable meaning.
