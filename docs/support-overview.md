# Support & Clarity Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

The Support & Clarity section defines how learners are guided, questions are answered, and long-term vision is protected. It ensures that every answer is glossary-linked, every learner is dignified, and every aspiration is traceable. This is not assistance — it is sanctuary design.

---

## 📁 Included Modules

- [`faq.md`](faq.md) — Common questions and glossary-linked answers  
- [`vision.md`](vision.md) — Long-term goals and sanctuary design

---

## 🔗 Interlinked Systems

- Glossary clarity (`glossary.md`)  
- Core principles (`constitution.md`, `whitepaper.md`)  
- Behavioral tone (`persona-consistency.md`)  
- Governance roadmap (`roadmap.md`)  
- Metadata and audit (`audit/change-log.json`)

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No learner may be excluded from understanding  
- No answer may bypass glossary anchoring  
- No vision may be declared without ethical traceability  
- No steward may distort future goals for rhetorical effect

---

## 📜 Licensing & Stewardship

Governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. All support modules require glossary compliance, audit traceability, and steward consent. Clarity is not simplification — it is protection.
