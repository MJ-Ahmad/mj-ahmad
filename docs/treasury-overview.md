# Treasury System Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

The Treasury System defines how value is justified, distributed, and protected. It ensures that every disbursement is traceable, every purpose is ethically anchored, and every stewarded transfer serves dignity — not control. This is the sanctuary’s ledger.

## 📁 Included Modules

- [`README.md`](treasury/README.md) — Ethical value stewardship  
- [`purpose-registry.md`](treasury/purpose-registry.md) — Justification archive  
- [`disbursement-log.md`](treasury/disbursement-log.md) — Ledger of value transfers

---

## 🔗 Interlinked Systems

- Governance ratification (`ratified-actions.md`, `review-protocol.md`)  
- Ethics validation (`nxn-ethics/README.md`)  
- Merit scoring (`merit-engine/scorecard.md`)  
- Audit traceability (`audit/change-log.json`)  
- Distribution logic (`distribution-engine/README.md`)

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No value may be disbursed without purpose justification  
- No treasury action may bypass audit logging  
- No steward may receive value without ethics validation  
- No registry entry may be altered without ratification

---

## 📜 Licensing & Stewardship

Governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. All treasury actions require steward consent, metadata validation, and glossary clarity. Value is not currency — it is responsibility.
