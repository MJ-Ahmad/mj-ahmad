## 🧭 Purpose

## 📚 Distribution Principles

- **No Commercialization**  
  Quranic content must never be sold, monetized, or used for profit.

- **Clarity First**  
  Every distributed copy must be child-readable, culturally safe, and semantically clear.

- **Traceable Origins**  
  Each version must include metadata: creation date, steward identity, and script lineage.

- **Consent-Based Access**  
  Distribution must be opt-in, with full transparency about format, source, and purpose.

- **Multilingual Integrity**  
  Translations must be documented, reviewed, and ratified by constitutional stewards.
