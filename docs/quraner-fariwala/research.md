## 🧭 Purpose

Quraner Fariwala is a constitutional research module designed to protect the integrity of Quranic scripts through ethical documentation, distortion prevention, and inheritable clarity. It is not a promotional initiative — it is a shield for truth.

---

## 📚 Research Objectives

- Preserve script-level clarity across regional variants (Uthmani, IndoPak, Bengali)
- Document interpretive boundaries to prevent distortion or misrepresentation
- Create child-readable, culturally safe formats for inclusive learning
- Establish metadata schemas for verse-level auditability
- Integrate ethical review protocols for all translations and annotations

---

## 🔍 Methodology

- Comparative script analysis using PowerShell-based audit logging
- Metadata tagging for surah, ayah, and script lineage
- Community review and ratification via [Visionary Roles](../governance/visionary-roles.md)
- Integration with Git-based version control for traceability

---

## 🛡️ Constitutional Boundaries

- No interpretation without documented lineage and steward approval
- No distribution without metadata, audit hash, and ethical license
- No modification of original scripts without ratified justification
- No exclusion of learners based on language, origin, or background
