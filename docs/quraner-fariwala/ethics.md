## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the ethical boundaries for interpreting, annotating, and distributing Quranic content within the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. It exists to prevent distortion, protect dignity, and ensure that all engagement with the Quran is traceable, respectful, and constitutionally governed.

## 🧠 Interpretive Boundaries

- **No Unverified Commentary**  
  All interpretations must cite lineage, scholarly consensus, and steward approval.

- **No Sectarian Bias**  
  Language must remain inclusive, non-divisive, and free from doctrinal favoritism.

- **No Emotional Exploitation**  
  Quranic references must not be used to manipulate, shame, or incite.

- **No Political Weaponization**  
  The Quran must not be invoked to justify power, control, or exclusion.

- **No Modification Without Audit**  
  Any script-level change must be documented, justified, and ratified.
