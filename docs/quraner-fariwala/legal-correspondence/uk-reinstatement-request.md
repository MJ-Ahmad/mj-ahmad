Dear Registrar,

I am writing as the constitutional steward of Quraner Fariwala Ltd, a UK-registered entity dedicated to Qurâ€™anic printing and distribution across South Asia.

Due to financial hardship and ethical survival constraints, I was unable to submit annual updates for the past two years. As a result, the company was disabled.

I hereby request:

- Reinstatement of the company or recognition of dormant status  
- Permission to resume operations aligned with our public documentation  
- Acknowledgment of our ethical stewardship and non-abandonment

Attached:

- [Legal Continuity Declaration](../quraner-fariwala-legal-continuity.md)  
- Company registration details  
- Intent to resume Qurâ€™an distribution and global outreach by Q1 2026

All stewardship work is publicly documented, traceable, and ethically ratified.

Sincerely,  
**MJ Ahmad**  
Steward of Ethical Inheritance
