# ðŸ“„ Request for Grace Period & Renewal Support

**To:** Trade License Authority, Dhaka City Corporation  
**From:** MJ Ahmad, Steward of Quraner Fariwala Ltd  
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Subject:** Request for Grace Period and Renewal Support

---

Dear Sir/Madam,

I respectfully submit this letter as the constitutional steward of Quraner Fariwala Ltd, a registered Qurâ€™an printing institution operating under trade license provisions in Dhaka.

Due to extreme financial hardship and ethical survival constraints, I have been unable to renew the trade license for the past two years. However, the institution remains active in purpose, documentation, and public transparency.

I hereby request:

- A grace period for renewal without penalty  
- Permission to resume operations under ethical stewardship  
- Recognition of our public documentation as proof of continuity

Attached:

- [Legal Continuity Declaration](../quraner-fariwala-legal-continuity.md)  
- Past trade license copy (to be appended)  
- Intent to resume Qurâ€™an printing and distribution by Q1 2026

I affirm that no commercial misuse has occurred, and all stewardship work is traceable and publicly logged.

Sincerely,  
**MJ Ahmad**  
Steward of Ethical Inheritance
