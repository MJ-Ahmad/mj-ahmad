**Curated by**: MJ Ahmad — Steward of Ethical Inheritance  
**Governance Type**: Participation Ethics  
**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025

## 🧭 Purpose

This charter defines the behavioral expectations, participation boundaries, and ethical commitments required of all contributors to the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. It is not a code of conduct — it is a constitutional agreement.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Radical Egalitarianism**  
  Every contributor is equal in dignity, regardless of background, skill, or identity.

- **Clarity Over Cleverness**  
  Contributions must prioritize clarity, reproducibility, and inheritance — not complexity or prestige.

- **No Hierarchy**  
  Roles are responsibilities, not ranks. No steward may claim authority over another.

- **No Exclusion**  
  No learner, contributor, or reader may be excluded based on language, culture, or ability.

- **No Ego**  
  All contributions must serve the system — not personal recognition or control.
