## 🧭 Purpose

This charter defines the shared values, ethical boundaries, and stewardship expectations for all contributors to the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. It is not a rulebook. It is a covenant.

## 🧘 Shared Values

- **Clarity** — Every file must be understandable to future learners  
- **Dignity** — No steward may be ranked, excluded, or erased  
- **Traceability** — Every change must be audit-bound and metadata-verified  
- **Ethics** — All logic must pass `nxn-ethics` validation  
- **Legacy** — Every contribution must serve future generations
