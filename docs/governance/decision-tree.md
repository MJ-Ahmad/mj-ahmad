## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No decision may bypass ethics validation  
- No artifact may be ratified without steward consent  
- No module may be indexed without audit traceability  
- No emergency override may skip documentation

---

## 🔐 Licensing

All decisions are governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. No logic may be executed without traceability, ethics, and consent.
