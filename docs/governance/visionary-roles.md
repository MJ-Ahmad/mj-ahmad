## 🛡️ Role Ethics

- No role may override the Constitution  
- No steward may act without traceable documentation  
- No contribution may be accepted without audit and review  
- All roles are equal in dignity, distinct in responsibility

---

## 🔐 Role Activation

To activate a role, a contributor must:

1. Read and agree to the [MJ-Ahmad Constitution](../constitution.md)  
2. Submit a signed `role-activation.md` artifact  
3. Pass a review by existing stewards  
4. Be listed in the `contributors.md` registry

---

## 🧾 Role Metadata

Each steward must maintain:

- `role`: Architect, Researcher, etc.  
- `date_activated`: ISO format  
- `modules_assigned`: Quraner Fariwala, Audit Engine, etc.  
- `audit_hash`: Git commit or SHA256 of role file  
- `persona_consistency`: Verified by Guardian
