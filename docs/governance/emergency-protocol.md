# Emergency Protocol — Constitutional Safeguard Sequence

**Curated by**: MJ Ahmad — Steward of Ethical Inheritance  
**Document Type**: Governance Response Protocol  
**Last Updated**: October 17, 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This protocol defines the steps to be taken when the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub faces existential risk — including logic corruption, ethics breach, metadata collapse, or unauthorized distribution. It is not a shutdown script. It is a ritual of recovery.

---

## 🚨 Activation Conditions

Emergency protocol may be triggered when:

- `nxn-ethics/violations.md` logs a systemic breach  
- `audit/change-log.json` shows tampering or deletion  
- `metadata` files are missing, falsified, or untraceable  
- `distribution-engine/README.md` is bypassed or corrupted  
- Steward roles are impersonated or erased  
- Glossary integrity is compromised, confusing learners

## 🧘 Steward Conduct

During emergency protocol, stewards must:

- Avoid blame or prestige  
- Preserve traceability  
- Protect learners above all  
- Document every step for inheritance

---

## 🔐 Licensing

All emergency actions are governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. No breach may be hidden, and no steward may be erased.
