## ✅ Ratifiable Artifacts

- New documentation modules  
- Logic rules and derivation boundaries  
- Glossary terms  
- Governance policies  
- Distribution protocols  
- Stewardship roles

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No artifact may be ratified without ethics validation  
- No steward may ratify their own artifact without peer review  
- No ratification may bypass audit logging  
- No module may be indexed without consent

---

## 🔐 Licensing

All ratifications are governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. No artifact may be inherited without traceability, ethics, and steward consent.
