# Audit Policy — Change Detection & Stewardship Logging

**Curated by**: MJ Ahmad — Steward of Ethical Inheritance  
**Governance Type**: Constitutional Audit Protocol  
**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This policy defines how changes, upgrades, and contributions are tracked, validated, and preserved within the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. It ensures that every modification is traceable, ethical, and inheritable.

---

## 🔍 Audit Principles

- **Traceability First**  
  Every change must leave a timestamped trail — no silent edits.

- **No Anonymous Contributions**  
  All changes must be linked to a steward identity and role.

- **Semantic Logging**  
  Audit logs must describe the nature, purpose, and impact of each change.

- **Version Integrity**  
  No overwrite without version bump and metadata update.

- **Constitutional Review**  
  Major changes must pass through [Visionary Roles](visionary-roles.md)

---

## 🧾 Audit Metadata Requirements

Each change must include:

- `changed_by`: Steward name or ID  
- `date_changed`: ISO format  
- `change_type`: correction, enhancement, refactor, etc.  
- `affected_files`: list of paths  
- `audit_hash`: Git commit or SHA256  
- `review_status`: pending, approved, rejected  
- `linked_issue`: optional reference to discussion or proposal

---

## 🛡️ Logging Tools

- PowerShell audit scripts (`audit.ps1`)  
- Git commit logs with signed messages  
- Metadata snapshots before and after change  
- Optional integration with GitHub Actions for CI validation

---

## 🔐 Enforcement

Any undocumented change is a constitutional violation. Stewards must correct or revert such changes and document the incident in `violations.md`.
