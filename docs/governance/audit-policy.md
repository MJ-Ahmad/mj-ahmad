## 🧭 Purpose

This policy defines how all changes within the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub are tracked, verified, and reviewed. It ensures that no edit is hidden, no steward is erased, and no artifact is lost.

## 🧾 Audit Artifacts

- `audit/change-log.json` — Ledger of all edits, hashes, and timestamps  
- `*.metadata.json` — Per-file metadata with review status and steward info  
- `review-protocol.md` — Artifact ratification and revision process  
- `violations.md` — Breach ledger for misuse or distortion

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No edit may bypass metadata or audit logging  
- No steward may erase another’s contribution  
- No artifact may be distributed without traceability  
- No logic may be altered without ethics validation

---

## 🔐 Licensing

All audit processes are governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. Traceability is not optional — it is constitutional.
