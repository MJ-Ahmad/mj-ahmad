# 📚 Learning Structure Protocol — Classes, Quizzes, and Mastery

**Steward:** MJ Ahmad  
**Purpose:**  
To define how learning modules, quizzes, and mastery layers are structured — ensuring every lesson is child-readable, audit-traceable, and ethically scaffolded.

---

## 🧭 Module Format

Each learning module should include:

- Title and Purpose  
- Step-by-step instructions  
- Code snippets (if applicable)  
- Reflections and next steps  
- Links to related modules  
- Quiz file (optional but encouraged)

---

## 🧪 Quiz Format

Each quiz should follow this structure:

- 5–10 multiple-choice questions  
- 1 correct answer per question  
- Explanation for each answer  
- Markdown format or YAML block  
- Linked from the module file

---

## 🧠 Reflection Prompts

Every module should include at least one reflection question:

- What surprised you?  
- What did you learn?  
- What will you do differently next time?

---

## 🧾 Metadata for Each Lesson

- `Module Code:`  
- `Created By:`  
- `Date:`  
- `Reviewed:` Yes / No  
- `Public/Private:` Public / Private / Mixed  
- `Linked Quiz:` `SDF-INIT-01-quiz.md` (example)

---

## 🔗 Folder Placement

- Modules go in `/Initiation/`, `/Observation/`, etc.  
- Quizzes go in the same folder as their module  
- Reflections and logs go in `/Logs/YYYY-MM-DD/`  
- Timeline entries go in `Timeline.md`

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No module may include unsafe, misleading, or exclusionary content  
- All lessons must be readable by beginners and future stewards  
- Every quiz must be fair, clear, and free of bias

---

_This protocol ensures that learning is not just technical — it is ethical, inheritable, and beautiful._
