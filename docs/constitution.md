# MJ-Ahmad Constitution

**Ratified by**: Steward of Ethical Inheritance (MJ Ahmad)  
**Effective Date**: October 16, 2025

---

## 🧭 Preamble

This constitution exists to protect clarity, preserve dignity, and ensure that all systems, scripts, and documents within the MJ-Ahmad ecosystem are governed by ethical inheritance.

---

## 📐 Articles of Stewardship

### Article I — Purpose
All artifacts must serve the long-term benefit of learners, researchers, and future stewards — not personal gain, vanity, or exclusion.

### Article II — Clarity
Every document must be understandable by others, especially those unfamiliar with the system. Ambiguity is a constitutional violation.

### Article III — Inheritance
All systems must be modular, reproducible, and documented in a way that allows others to adopt, adapt, and extend them without dependency on the original author.

### Article IV — Equality
No artifact shall discriminate based on language, religion, race, gender, or origin. All humans are equal in dignity and access.

### Article V — Auditability
Every system must leave a traceable, timestamped trail of changes. Nothing hidden, nothing lost.

## 🛡️ Enforcement

Violations of this constitution — including undocumented logic, exclusionary language, or unverifiable claims — must be flagged, documented, and corrected through the Stewardship Decision Tree.
