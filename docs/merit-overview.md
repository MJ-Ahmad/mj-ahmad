# Merit System Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

The Merit System defines how contributions are recognized, scored, and ethically validated. It protects the system from prestige-based bias, ensures traceable stewardship, and honors effort through transparent logic. This is not hierarchy — it is earned clarity.

## 📁 Included Modules

- [`README.md`](merit-engine/README.md) — Overview of merit logic  
- [`scorecard.md`](merit-engine/scorecard.md) — Contribution scoring and ethics

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No contribution may be scored without ethics validation  
- No steward may receive merit without glossary-linked traceability  
- No scorecard may be altered without ratification  
- No prestige-based logic may override ethical scoring

---

## 📜 Licensing & Stewardship

Governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. All merit logic requires steward consent, metadata validation, and audit traceability. Recognition is not reward — it is responsibility.
