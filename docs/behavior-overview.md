# Behavioral Governance Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

The Behavioral Governance section defines how the system speaks — its tone, clarity, and ethical voice. It protects learners from exclusion, ensures child-readable language, and enforces persona consistency across all modules. This is the mirror of the system’s soul.

---

## 📁 Included Modules

- [`persona-consistency.md`](behavior/persona-consistency.md) — Defines tone, language, and constitutional clarity

---

## 🔗 Interlinked Systems

- Glossary clarity (`glossary.md`)  
- Ethics validation (`nxn-ethics/README.md`)  
- Governance legitimacy (`role-activation.md`, `review-protocol.md`)  
- Core principles (`constitution.md`, `whitepaper.md`)  
- Violation logging (`nxn-ethics/violations.md`)

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No module may use prestige-based or exclusionary tone  
- All language must be glossary-linked and child-readable  
- No steward may distort the system’s voice for rhetorical effect  
- All violations must be reviewed and logged

---

## 📜 Licensing & Stewardship

Governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. All behavioral protocols require ratification, audit traceability, and glossary compliance. Persona is not style — it is stewardship.
