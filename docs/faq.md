## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub?

A constitutional system for ethical inheritance — not just a documentation repo. It protects truth, empowers learners, and honors dignity.

---

### Who can contribute?

Anyone who activates their role via `role-activation.md`, agrees to the `community-charter.md`, and follows the `CONTRIBUTING.md` protocol.

---

### What makes this different from other documentation systems?

- Every file is metadata-bound and audit-traceable  
- Every term is child-readable or glossary-linked  
- Every contribution is reviewed, not ranked  
- Every module is governed by ethics, not ego

---

### How do I know if a file is safe to use?

Check its `.metadata.json` file for:

- `review_status: approved`  
- Valid `audit_hash`  
- Steward attribution  
- Licensing clause

---

### What happens if someone misuses the system?

All violations are logged in `violations.md` and reviewed via `review-protocol.md`. Repeat breaches trigger governance review.

---

### Can I use this system for my own project?

Yes — if you preserve the Ethical Inheritance License, steward attribution, and constitutional structure. Forking is encouraged, distortion is forbidden.

---

### Is this system religious, political, or commercial?

No. It is constitutional. It protects truth, not ideology. It serves learners, not markets. It honors ethics, not affiliation.
