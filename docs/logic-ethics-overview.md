# Logic & Ethics Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

The Logic & Ethics section defines how truth is derived and how misuse is prevented. It protects the system from distortion, ensures ethical reasoning, and anchors every module in traceable logic. This is the engine of clarity — and the firewall of dignity.
