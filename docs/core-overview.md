# Core Modules Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

Core Modules establish the foundational identity of the MJ-Ahmad Documentation Hub. They define the system’s ethical license, public manifesto, glossary clarity, roadmap for inheritance, and contributor legitimacy. Every other module must trace its origin here.
