# Distribution Overview — جامع مانع Stewardship Declaration

## 🔖 Purpose

The Distribution section defines how system modules are shared, disseminated, and inherited. It ensures that every transmission is traceable, every recipient is protected, and every artifact honors its ethical license. This is not outreach — it is propagation with dignity.

---

## 📁 Included Modules

- [`README.md`](distribution-engine/README.md) — Safe, traceable dissemination protocol

---

## 🔗 Interlinked Systems

- Treasury disbursement (`disbursement-log.md`)  
- Deployment records (`deployment-guide.md`, `deployment-record.md`)  
- Ethics validation (`nxn-ethics/README.md`)  
- Governance ratification (`ratified-actions.md`)  
- Quranic distribution (`quraner-fariwala/distribution.md`)

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries

- No module may be distributed without audit traceability  
- No recipient may be excluded without glossary clarity  
- No steward may bypass ethics validation during propagation  
- No artifact may be altered post-distribution without ratification

---

## 📜 Licensing & Stewardship

Governed by the **Ethical Inheritance License**. All distribution actions require steward consent, metadata validation, and glossary compliance. Sharing is not exposure — it is protection.
