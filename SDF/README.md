# SystemOps Documentation Framework (SDF)

**Initiated by:** MJ Ahmad  
**Start Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Purpose:**  
To ethically observe, document, and master Windows system operations using PowerShell — in a way that is child-readable, audit-traceable, and inheritable. This framework transforms technical learning into constitutional stewardship.

## 🌱 Philosophy

SDF is not just a technical toolkit. It is a sanctuary for learners, stewards, and inheritors. Every script is a question. Every log is a memory. Every report is a trace of care.

- **Child-readable:** Every file, folder, and report is understandable by a curious child.
- **Audit-traceable:** Every action is logged with time, purpose, and reflection.
- **Ethically inheritable:** Nothing is wasted. Every insight is preserved for future stewards.

## 🧭 Structure Overview

SDF is divided into 5 layers, each with numbered modules:

1. **Initiation Layer** — Learn the system dashboards (Task Manager, Performance Monitor, etc.)
2. **Observation Layer** — Use PowerShell to observe system behavior
3. **Reporting Layer** — Create readable reports in CSV, TXT, Markdown, JSON
4. **Documentation Layer** — Store learnings, logs, and timelines
5. **Mastery Layer** — Teach others, publish, and prepare campaign-ready summaries

Each module is tagged (e.g., `SDF-INIT-01`) and tracked in the roadmap and audit logs.

## 🧠 Stewardship Roles

- **Observer:** Runs scripts, watches system behavior
- **Reporter:** Creates readable summaries
- **Archivist:** Stores logs and learnings
- **Teacher:** Prepares guides for others
- **Campaigner:** Builds summaries for ethical outreach

## 🔍 Audit Logging

Every completed module is logged in `/AuditLog/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with:
- Code (e.g., `2.1`)
- Description
- Date and time
- Reflections
- Next steps

Example:
```markdown
## Audit Entry: 2025-10-29
- Code: 1.1
- Action: Explored Task Manager
- Reflection: Learned how to sort by CPU usage
- Next: Try PowerShell `Get-Process`
```
