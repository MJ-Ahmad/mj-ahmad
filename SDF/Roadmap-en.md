**Initiated by:** MJ Ahmad  
**Start Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Purpose:**  
To master Windows system observation, reporting, and documentation using PowerShell ‚Äî in a way that is child-readable, audit-traceable, and ethically inheritable.

## üîç Audit Logging Setup

Each completed module will be logged in `/AuditLog/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with:

- **Code:** Module code (e.g., `SDF-OBS-01`)
- **Action:** What was done or learned
- **Date:** Timestamp
- **Reflection:** Personal insight or challenge
- **Next Step:** What comes next

Example:
```markdown
## Audit Entry: 2025-10-29
- Code: SDF-INIT-01
- Action: Explored Task Manager
- Reflection: Learned how to sort processes by CPU usage
- Next Step: Try PowerShell `Get-Process`
